# Othello

IN this project, I created an Othello or 'reversi' game where the game starts off with 4 pieces on the board; 2 are white and 2 are black. 
Whoever is black goes first and chooses a location on the baord where it has a white piece in between two black black pieces. All white pieces.     
in between are then flipped to black pieces and it changes to the white user's turn.

The main data structure I used to code this game is a double array which stored all my data quite neatly.

The Square class draws all the squares on the board and circle class draws the pieces for both black and white circle users. The GameMouseListener 
class uses the MouseListener interface to get an alert every time somewhere is clicked. This is then connected to the GameBoard class which
repaints the circles according to what is now black and what is now white.

Coding this assignment demonstrated knowledge in my object oriented design and programming abilities.
